## Controller Layer

The controller layer handles the incoming requests from the client, routes it to the appropriate service or data access layer, and then sends the response back to the client.  The controller layer handles tasks such as input validation, request processing, and response formatting.

## Service Layer

The service layer contains the business logic for the application.  It is responsible for performing the actual tasks required by the application.  The service layer interacts with the data access layer or external APIs to perform CRUD operations and data validation.
